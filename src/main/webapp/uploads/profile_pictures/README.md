# Profile Pictures Directory

This directory is used to store user profile pictures for the Hamro Bank application.

## Notes

- This directory should be included in version control, but its contents (except for this README) should be ignored
- Profile pictures are served by the ProfilePictureServlet
- If a user doesn't have a profile picture, a default one is used from the images directory
