# Uploads Directory

This directory is used to store user-uploaded files for the Hamro Bank application.

## Structure

- `profile_pictures/`: Contains user profile pictures
- Other subdirectories may be added as needed for different types of uploads

## Notes

- This directory should be included in version control, but its contents (except for this README) should be ignored
- In a production environment, consider using a dedicated file storage service instead of storing files in the application directory
